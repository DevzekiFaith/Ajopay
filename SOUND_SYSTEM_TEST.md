# Sound System Test Results

## âœ… **Problem Fixed**

The 404 error for `success.mp3` has been resolved by:

1. **Direct Tone Generation**: System now generates tones directly instead of trying to load non-existent files
2. **No More 404 Errors**: Eliminated all attempts to fetch missing sound files
3. **Consistent Audio**: All sounds are now generated tones with distinct patterns

## ðŸŽµ **Sound Patterns**

| Sound Type | Pattern | Frequency | Description |
|------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `transaction` | Single | 900Hz | Single tone for transactions |
| `deposit` | Double | 1000Hz | Two quick tones for deposits |
| `coin` | Triple | 1200Hz | Three quick tones for large deposits |
| `notification` | Single | 600Hz | Single tone for notifications |
| `success` | Double | 800Hz | Two tones for success |
| `error` | Single | 400Hz | Single low tone for errors |

## ðŸš€ **Console Output**

You should now see:
```
Sound system initialized with generated tones
```

Instead of:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/sounds/success.mp3 404 (Not Found)
