# Middleware Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Removed `/agent` from protected routes** - Agent system was removed
2. **Added `/agent` redirect** - Redirects to `/customer` page
3. **Added environment variable checks** - Prevents crashes if env vars are missing
4. **Added comprehensive error handling** - Catches and logs errors gracefully
5. **Excluded API routes from matcher** - Prevents middleware from running on API calls
6. **Added auth error handling** - Handles Supabase auth failures gracefully

## Key Changes:

- ✅ Removed agent system references
- ✅ Added try-catch blocks for error handling
- ✅ Added environment variable validation
- ✅ Added special handling for `/agent` route
- ✅ Improved matcher to exclude API routes
- ✅ Added proper error logging

## Expected Results:

- ✅ No more `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED` errors
- ✅ Proper authentication flow
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Agent routes redirect to customer
- ✅ API routes work without middleware interference

The middleware should now work correctly on Vercel deployment.
